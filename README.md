# An-adaptive-weight-method-for-image-retrieval-based-multi-feature-fusion
Aiming at the problem that the retrieval accuracy of existing content-based image retrieval system is low. We propose an adaptive weighting method based on entropy theory and relevance feedback. Firstly, we obtain single feature trust by relevance feedback (supervised) or entropy (unsupervised); Next, We construct a transfer matrix based on trust. Finally, based on the transfer matrix, we get the weight of single feature through several iterations. Our method makes full use of single feature information of image and achieve better performance.
